My attempt at recreating Google homepage

This was my first attempt at building something from scratch on HTML and CSS. It was a bit challenging at first, but once I got started, it was very engaging and fun! I did have to use Google quite a bit for some guidance.

A couple of quirks that I could not figure out and will have to come back to:

1.  The Sign-In "button" in the navigation bar: I don't know why, but I couldn't get the font color to change from the default hyperlink blue color to the white color that I wanted.

2.  Search bar: When you click the cursor inside the field to start typing, I want the blinking cursor to start a little more right of the magnifying glass icon. No idea how to do this.
